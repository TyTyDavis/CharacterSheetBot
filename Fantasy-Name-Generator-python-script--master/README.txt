Fantasy name generator by Luuk van Wolferen

How to use:
-run fantasy_name_generator.py

This name generator randomly pulls names from first_name_male.txt or first_name_female.txt, and from last_name.txt.
To add custom names just put them in the appropriate txt files. Make sure to give each name it's own line.
